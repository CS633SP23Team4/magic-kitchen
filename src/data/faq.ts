    question: "How to boil an egg?",
    answer:
      "To get the perfect boiled egg, you want to use a small pan of simmering water (enough to cover the eggs), lowering them into the water using a spoon. For soft boiled eggs cook for 3 ½min for medium or 4min for large and then serve immediately.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "If you want hard boiled eggs, cook for 8-10min, depending on the size. Once cooked, drain and cool quickly under cold running water to stop a black rim forming around the yolk. When ready to serve, crack the shell and peel.",

    question: "How to cook asparagus?",
    answer:
      "Asparagus is a versatile ingredient, and adds a delicate flavour to a variety of dishes. But to cook it properly we recommend cutting the spears about two inches from the stalk end, before putting them into a large pan of salted water that will allow them to sit in a single layer. Cook for about 5-8mins until tender.",

    question: "How to cook steak?",
    answer:
      "Remove your steak from the fridge about half an hour before cooking as it’s best cooked at room temperature. Pat it dry with kitchen paper, and then oil the meat rather than the pan.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "For medium-rare to medium, cook for roughly two to three minutes per side, while for well done it’s about five minutes per side, turning the heat down once the steak gets to medium rare. Always rest the steak for a couple of minutes before serving to allow the juices to reabsorb.",

    question: "How to cut a mango?",
    answer:
      "Cut lengthwise down the mango, either side of the flat stone, as close to it as possible. Score the flesh of each piece with a criss-cross pattern, before pushing the skin upwards to expose the flesh.",

    question: "How to cook rice?",
    answer:
      "Add long grain rice to a pan with a pinch of salt and twice the volume of water. Bring to the boil, cover the pan and reduce the heat to low. Cook without uncovering the pan for around 15 minutes to keep in the steam. The rice is ready when it’s just tender and steam holes appear on the surface.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Once the rice is cooked, fluff up the grains gently by tossing with a fork, this keeps grains from sticking together. Remove from the heat and serve.",

    question: "How to make buttermilk?",
    answer:
      "Pour 1tbsp vinegar into a 1-cup measure. Fill the measuring cup the rest of the way with milk and stir. Let sit for about 5 minutes, or until milk curdles.",

    id: "6",
    question: "Does meat REALLY need to rest before I slice and serve it?",
    answer:
      "Proteins are tight in hot meat, and all the juices get pushed to the middle. Letting it rest for a few minutes allows the proteins to relax (which makes it more tender) and evenly distributes the juices.",

    question: "What's a good rule of thumb for using dried herbs instead of fresh?",
    answer:
      "In general, use one-third the amount of dried herbs to replace chopped fresh. If a recipe calls for 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, use 1 teaspoon dried. The most flavor is released by adding dried herbs toward the beginning of cooking.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "When a recipe calls for just butter, should I use salted or unsalted?",
    answer:
      "When baking, you generally want to use unsalted butter. Cooking with unsalted butter gives you more control over how salty the final dish tastes, so it’s a good idea. However, keep salted butter at the table to spread on fresh bread!",

    id: "9",
    question: "How can I store fresh herbs so that they last?",
    answer:
      "Hardy herbs such as rosemary, thyme, and sage can also be stored in the fridge. Start by washing and drying the hardy herbs thoroughly (just like you would soft herbs). Trim off about an inch of the stem. Wrap or roll the herbs in damp paper towels so that you cover the entire herb, then store them in a ziploc bag in the fridge. ",
